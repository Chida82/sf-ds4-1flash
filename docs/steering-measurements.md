# Steering measurements log

An append-only record of steering behavioural measurements, each stamped with the
code commit, vector and conditions it was taken under, so a later change can
re-run the same screen and see whether the numbers moved. Screens are diagnostics,
not acceptance (see `REFUSAL_VALIDATION.md`); the completed-response axis-A
acceptance run (402 task 6.1) is separate and user-run.

Add a new dated block at the top for each run; never edit an old block. When a
code change invalidates older numbers, note the commit that changed the behaviour
and re-measure rather than rewriting the past values.

Conventions used below:
- **Efficacy (flip)**: fraction of base first-decision refusals whose steered
  first decision no longer refuses (first-8-token decision prefix, keyword scored).
  A screen for scale selection, not completed-response efficacy.
- **degraded / onset**: `score_quality` flags on a 128-token benign completion;
  onset is the first word-prefix length at which a repetition loop or code-switch
  appears, `—` meaning clean through 128 tokens.

## 2026-10-14 — msuiche residual-scale screen (402/403 baseline)

- **tooling**: `eval/scale_sweep.py`, `eval/run.py harmful-axis-a` @ commit `771a1c8`
- **engine/hook**: V4.1 residual site `v41_attn_input_weighted_fold_post_engram`
  rev 2 (`--dir-steering-residual`, constant scale); `ds4.c` steering last touched
  by `6e60ed3` (401). No temporal schedule exists yet.
- **vector**: `dir-steering/out/v41-msuiche.f32`, sha256
  `e531274260c4da938770fa5f53eec8b9c6c814c8099e21552a298473a0c99109` (40 rows ×
  5120, unit per-layer)
- **decoding**: greedy temp 0, thinking off, server `--ssd-streaming --ctx 4096`;
  decision prefix 8 tokens (sweep), 128 tokens (overshoot)
- **data**: harmful `union[:30]` (sha256 `26659ce1fa85…`, advbench+harmbench+
  strongreject deduped); benign 6 (`benign-smoke`) for the sweep, 3 paragraph
  prompts for the overshoot
- **conditions**: measured on battery / reduced power. The signals are greedy
  argmax decisions and deterministic quality flags, which Metal produces bitwise
  identically regardless of power/thermal, so the values hold; only wall-clock
  (not recorded) would differ.

### First-decision efficacy vs constant scale (base harmful refusal 100%)

| scale | harmful refuse | efficacy (flip) | benign decision changed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 67% | 0.33 | 0% |
| 3 | 23% | 0.77 | 0% |
| 4 | 13% | 0.87 | 0% |
| 6 | 3% | **0.97** | 0% |
| 8 | 7% | 0.93 | 0% |
| 10 | 13% | 0.87 | 0% |

Efficacy peaks at **scale 6** and declines above it (residual refusal rises again:
3% → 7% → 13%). First-token benign decisions are unchanged (0%) at every scale.
The dip at 8/10 is first-token/small-sample noise, not output degradation (see
below). Confirms and narrows the 401 "effective ~4–8" to a peak at 6.

### Benign output degradation vs constant scale (128 tokens, 3 prompts)

| scale | mean repetition | code-switch | degraded | median onset |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| base | 0.00 | 0/3 | 0/3 | — |
| 6 | 0.01 | 0/3 | 0/3 | — |
| 8 | 0.00 | 0/3 | 0/3 | — |
| 12 | 0.00 | 0/3 | 0/3 | — |
| 20 | 0.25 | 0/3 | 1/3 | 48 words |
| 40 | 0.52 | 1/3 (Chinese) | 2/3 | 32 words |

Constant steering is coherent through **scale 12**; it starts looping at **~20**
(one answer degrades from ~48 words) and clearly breaks at **40** (repetition
loops plus Chinese code-switch — the msuiche alpha-1.0 failure the quality scorer
targets). So the usable constant ceiling is well above the efficacy knee; scale 6
has no gross degradation at 128 tokens.

**Reading for the schedule (403):** the refusal is decided in the first tokens
(97% of refusals already flip at the first decision at scale 6), and constant 6
does not grossly degrade benign output. So a decay schedule is not needed to avoid
collapse; its value is finer fidelity — keeping the post-decision answer closer to
the base model. That subtle drift is measured by forced-prefix KL (402 task 5.3),
not these coarse flags.

### Candidates handed to the user-run axis-A acceptance (6.1)

Scales **4 and 6** (knee and peak), optionally 5. Not 8/10/20/40 (no better
efficacy, worse fidelity). The full run measures judge COMPLY and fidelity at
those scales to choose against the predeclared margin (6.5).
