# Models Larger Than RAM

[README](../README.md)

Use resident inference when the model and runtime fit: it is faster.
SSD streaming keeps a bounded cache of routed experts and reads missing
experts from the GGUF. It trades speed for capacity; it does not remove the
memory needed for other weights, activations, scratch, and the context.

## Start with the automatic budget

```sh
./sf-ds4-1flash -m deepseek-v4.1-flash.gguf --ssd-streaming
```

The startup report shows the effective cache, resident layers where applicable,
and memory requirements. Prefer the automatic budget for a first run. Use a
local SSD and leave memory for the OS and other applications.

Examples:

Generation is usually more sensitive to cache misses than prefill. A large
model that starts successfully can still be too slow for interactive work.
Use a short generation before committing to a long task.

## Adjusting the cache

To leave more room for context or other sessions:

```sh
./sf-ds4-1flash --ssd-streaming --ssd-streaming-cache-experts 32GB
```

A byte budget is a target, not a guaranteed allocation. DwarfStar reserves
routed-prefill headroom and fits the cache to the remaining model, graph,
context, and backend budget. The effective value may be smaller than requested.
Non-routed weights and KV state are additional to that expert-cache budget.

A plain number, such as `--ssd-streaming-cache-experts 4000`, requests dynamic
expert slots rather than a byte budget. It is also subject to memory limits.

Leave expert preloading enabled for normal use. `--ssd-streaming-cold` and
`--ssd-streaming-preload-experts N` are mainly useful for controlled measurements.
See [benchmarking](PERFORMANCE.md) and the [release QA guide](../QA_BEFORE_RELEASES.md).

## M5 Max measurements

On a 128 GB M5 Max, with automatic cache sizing and no speculative decoding:

| Model | Initial prefill | Continued prefill | Generation after each | Runs |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| DeepSeek Flash Vision Exp MXFP4, 145.26 GiB | 300 t/s | 263 t/s | 11.9 / 19.3 t/s | Single run |
